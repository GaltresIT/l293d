## Installation

To install the Python library:
1. #### Clone code from GitHub
       git clone https://github.com/jamesevickery/l293d.git
2. #### Navigate to the l293d folder

       cd l293d/
3. #### Install the library:

       $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip
       $ sudo python setup.py install

4. #### Test

       $ python
       $ import l293d.l293d as l293d

   If importing the library forces test mode, check if GPIO.RPi is installed:
       sudo apt-get install RPi.GPIO
   This should only work on a Raspberry Pi, however other devices may be used to test the functionality of this library.
