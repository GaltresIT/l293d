#Contributing

To contribute, any pull requests are happily accepted, but any large changes should be suggested in an issue first.

Code should work with both Python 2 & 3, and be [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)-compliant.
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jamesevickery/l293d) automatically checks code complies with PEP8 and that the tests (in [`tests/`](https://github.com/jamesevickery/l293d/tree/master/tests) directory) all pass.
